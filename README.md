####To contribute;
You don't need to know code to help out here. Even this README could need some editing !<br />
Head over to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/mathhub/mathub/wiki) to read about a few requirements before you dig your hands into some [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) goodness :)<br />
While you're at it, see what you can do to help write the Wiki itself ! For future and current users.
- While using the website and try to spot [bugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) and [report](http://github.com/mathhub.mathub) it.

If you do want to contribute code, it is necessary to have some basic working knowledge of git. And of course the elemental workings of HTML, CSS and some Javascript. [Code Academy](http://codecademy.com) has some great tutorials which could help you come up to speed. The [Wiki page](https://github.com/mathhub/mathub/wiki) outlines the steps you should take to submit viable pull requests. That way, changes you make would reflect in the original code and your changes would be added to Mathub !
